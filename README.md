My CS32 Final Project

I will be building a program to play chess with another user. The program will check user inputs for valid piece movements, keep track of the positions of the pieces on the board, and print out a chess board in the counsel using unicode for each turn. The program will end when one player is checkmated or there are no valid moves for a player to make (stalemate).
